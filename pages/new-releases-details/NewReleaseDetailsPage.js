    "Origins pays homage to the genesis of graffiti art originating from the San Bushmen. The bushmen crushed up a red ochre mineral into fine powder. They would then put it in their mouth and spray it over their hands and onto the rock face which would create a hand print. This made them the original graffiti artists. ",
